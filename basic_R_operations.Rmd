# Introduction

This report is to demonstrate how to create a dataframe in R and do a few simple operations.

## Create a new dataframe

We can create a toy dataframe from the below code:

```{r create_df}
df <- data.frame(name = c('John', 'Ty', 'Jim'),
                 age = c(21, 30, 45),
                 title = c('Estimator', 'Engineer', 'Manager'))
df
```

## Operations on dataframe

We can select a particular column and output the specified column only.

```{r select}
# load necessary library
library(tidyverse)

df_1 <- df |> select(title)
df_1
```

We can filter the dataframe based on a certain condition. In the following example, it will only output people with their age over 30.

```{r filter}
df_2 <- df |> filter(age >30)
df_2
```
